    <h2>Our Story 💕</h2>
    <p>
    It all started with a LinkedIn message after I watched his honest interview.
    He guided me, supported me, and helped me reach my goal.
    Somewhere between guidance and conversations, motivation and late replies,
    we became friends. And one fine day, without even realizing it,
    friendship turned into love.
    <br><br>

    A message became conversations,<br>
    Guidance became care,<br>
    Dreams became achievements,<br>
    And careers led our hearts together. ✨💞
    <br><br>

    “It started with a LinkedIn message… and turned into a lifetime connection. 💫❤️”
